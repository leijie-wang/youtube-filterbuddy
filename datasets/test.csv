"The answers that most give in this interview are quite the paradox considering the traditional beliefs of someone who considers themselves Conservative. The general consensus is that big government is bad but these people are arguing for bigger military and for government to help with things such as interest rates, the economy and I'd imagine many other aspects to improve their lives. I feel like most of the problems that these people face are based on big business that greatly influences policies and regulations in their favor. Our economy is based on the buying and selling of goods (which the government has little control over). Absolutely our government overspends (and both parties I might add are equally guilty) but historically the stock market has performed better under Democratic presidents for the last few decades. Most people are looking for a savior and assume their candidate will fix all of their problems without acknowledging their own issues; life is a roller coaster of ups and downs regardless of who is in office.",2024-02-12 09:37:45,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.054779384,['en']

"After WW2, we were justifiably proud to be Americans.  We all pulled together and defeated the Nazis and the Empire of Japan.
In the post-war period, we kept pulling together to advance the country.  
With the production potential of Europe and Japan in ruins, the American economy roared to life like never before.
It seemed like everyone was going to college and buying a house and a car.  It was a amazing time for America because there was no competition.
People all over the world got to see post-war America in films and couldn't believe how prosperous and well fed we were.
America was the envy of the world, and we started to believe that this was due to Americans being exceptional as people.
(It wasn't.  It was because everyone else got leveled by WW2 and would take some time to recover. The rest of the world was  buying stuff made in America and that really helped us grow.)

Although the economy was booming in the 50's and early 60's, we were really only beginning to deal with social problems like racism and sexism.
The post-war period of prosperity also ushered in an age of domestic strife due to the racist resistance to the Civil Right's Movement.
We also got stuck cleaning up the damage from WW2 in the Pacific Rim.  The Korean War, and the Vietnam conflict both overlapped with the Civil Right's and Women's Movements.
This led to a connection between racism and the economy of the post-war boom.

If you were a conservative from  the 50's to the 90's, you were generally against the Civil Right's Movement, and the women's right's movement.
You were probably also for the war in Vietnam.
Republican support for the wars and their simultaneous disdain for women's right and civil rights for non-whites drew the battle lines for the current crisis.
Members of the press sided with the social movements and against the wars.  This led to Republicans creating their own propaganda channels when cable TV emerged.

In short... Americans are not exceptional, racism in America is real, and it's all the Republican's fault.",2024-02-07 15:26:09,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.11419344,['en']

"Interesting that Reagan was brought up.  The vast majority of Trump's policies were and are opposite of Ronald Reagan's.  Reagan strong on Defense and aggressive foreign policy, especially with regards to Russia and China. Reagan was for the government out of all aspects of a person's private lives, Trump wants to tell people what they have to believe in and what they can and can not do behind their own closed doors. Reagan was for free enterprise and the belief that the american worker, when left to his own devices and absent of government interference, would prevail, Trump wanted to do away with a free trade economy and even went so far to put high tariffs on items like Scotch Whiskey and Chocolate even though those items did not compete with American items.  His so called ""Huge deal!"" with China was a joke, but he had to show something for tanking the Stock Markets with his over reaching tariffs.  Reagan was no fan of the religious right, nor were they one of his.  They did get behind him for one reason and one reason only, he felt the logic used in Roe v Wade was wrong, and it was, but he was not anti-abortion, he signed the very first law in America legalizing abortion on demand as governor of California. He was a state's rights advocate, Trump wants to delegate from his ""throne room"" in the White House. I am a college educated Goldwater/Reagan Republican with a Political Science degree I obtained in the 1980s, I was a proud ""right winger"" back then, and called one by my professors, I am embarrassed with the so called self proclaimed Right Wingers of today who are in reality for government interjecting itself in peoples' private lives (that is what the religious right is all about) and tend to be more inline philosophically with Bernie Sanders than with Ronald Reagan.",2024-02-06 05:07:59,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.112643376,['en']

"People need to ask one question and be honest. When is the last time a Republican administration left this country in better shape than it inherited? You have to go back decades. Bush Sr. (a one term failure) left this country in a recession and sky high deficits in '92 before Clinton took over and cleaned up the mess and got this country back on a sustainable path fiscally that was out of control under Reagan/Bush. 

After Clinton gave him rosy conditions to start his Presidency in 2001, Bush Jr. (who should have been a one term President) had this country decimated on all fronts on his way out of the door with the economy collapsing hemorrhaging 600k jobs a month, a housing crisis leaving people homeless, a stock market crash with people losing their retirement and life savings, our industries in peril, two wars being fought on the government credit card and a 1.4 trillion dollar deficit with hardly any government revenue coming in, all left at the feet of the Obama/Biden administration to clean up. 

Once again after cleaning up the GIGANTIC mess from his inept predecessor, Obama gave Trump a stable economy with declining unemployment, a shrinking deficit at only 580 billion, $2 gas prices, a stock market hitting record highs, and a construction boom. Instead of continuing the momentum to get this country's fiscal path in black ink and sustainable, Trump and the RINOs followed the familiar Republican footsteps and used the Bush playbook to immediately spike the deficit his first year in office with a permanent ""tax cut"" (aka wealth transfer to his donor class, not us) who didn't really need it since they were already making record profits, and then went on a spending spree while the ""fiscal conservatives"" rubber-stamped all of his spending without a single manufactured debt ceiling crisis ü§∑üèª 

By the end of Trump's single term of failure and incompetence the country had amassed a 3.1 trillion dollar deficit (fiscal conservatives ü§¶üèª) that laid the yellow brick road right to inflation, manufacturing in a recession (before Covid), tariffs taxing American businesses driving up prices (before Covid), farmers decimated nationwide and on 2+ years on taxpayer billion dollar welfare bailouts just to keep the lights on (before Covid), the BLS revising job totals to 501,000 less than estimates (before Covid). In other words, another clusterfk Republican administration that left another mess to be cleaned up. This is a pattern that people are catching on to which is why Republicans have been on the longest losing streak in modern political history.",2024-02-04 19:55:07,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.1883923,['en']

"America has NEVER been great!!!  You can take a look at US history by decade from 1776 to present and there is always something, sometimes many things, that keep America from being great.  Remember that In the beginning in America only land owning White men could vote; that excluded a large segment of the population.  Native American in the beginning and for many years were not even considered people; they were relegated to shoot them on sight.  Slavery did not end until the 1860's and then that period was followed by laws enacted by white people called Slave Codes (look it up) and then there was for years Jim Crow laws and segregation that excluded Black American from that ""life, liberty' and pursuit of happiness' that is in the US Constitution.  And then it was not until after 1920 that women were allowed to vote; America could NOT be great when only White males were allowed to vote.  And then it was not until the 1960's that Black people began to have the freedom to vote.

Now I can agree that there have been some great American people, who have done great things, i.e. sending a crew to the moon and returning safely.

"You can scoff at these people, and call them names. But they successfully got a President in. A really, really bad one! That's a problem. You don't solve it by laughing at it. We need to understand what's underlying this. Very few people are buttholes on purpose. They just see things differently and have different priorities.

Although a famous survey years back showed that, when you put things in concrete terms, most Americans actually agree on most issues. It's party politics, and the ""sports team"" or tribal mentality, that creates these apparently insurmountable differences. Trump's supporters obviously felt excluded enough by the other options, that they overlooked his obvious terribleness as a human being and voted him into office. That's an issue that ought to be fixed, the role Trump takes in those people's minds ought to be filled, but by someone reasonable.

The way people consider anything they don't agree with to be false is a desperate problem. You can't run a society where people don't agree on basic reality.

"America is great because people can speak their mind without being judged. So stop judging people because the Hollywood and social media narrative is that white people especially Christians are racist, intolerant, and bigoted.

Going to liberal arts college doesn't make you less of a jerk or prejudice, and declaring anyone who doesn't agree a Trump supporter or an uneducated white entitled racist IS racism. For the record entitlement is color blind. Statistically there are more white people in America than every other minority group because they were the original settlers. Obviously that means a larger percent of them are richer and have larger inheritances.

Who's feeding this shite to these poor guys? It hasn't been Trump for some time. His agitprop machine goes marching on and these folks are marching to its beat. Amazing. DJT has managed to side-step any actual campaigning by being a multiple-indicted criminal who can be found defending himself as a victim publicly  and beiing tied up on his cross in the meantime. He's bequeathed his Fascist messaging to his info army.  The law and the court system will, at election time, state clearly that they did everything to abide the legal process, while the one who has no regard for the law being on a ballot. It will then be left to the voters. It must be a landslide defeat everywhere. These poor people will be disappointed, but they won't be as disappointed as they otherwise would be when waking to their complicity in bringing about Fascism, to which they will not be immune and from which they will not be exempt from profound loss of all they ever imagined was great about America.",2024-02-02 22:42:53,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.45703048,['en']

"Yeah, they don't know. Unfortunately there's many Democrats just as dumb, uninformed, and hoodwinked. And that's as if there's any important difference between the two American parties. On anything that matters, they're both the parties of big business and power, owned by their lobbyists and tied to the same strings they pull on other people.

I can see the appeal of Trump to the disillusioned. He claims not to be part of that system, and to some degree he isn't. The fact that he's a massive evil butthole isn't important to them. They're idealists, but their ideal of honest politics that helps ordinary people is absolutely aimed at the wrong person. The fact his claims are so vague, and so his voters' knowledge is so vague, is deliberate. He makes shit up on the spot, calls people names, then shits himself and they have to clear the room.

I can see the man they want to lead them, it's just not the man that Trump is. But standards are so low now, people are willing to follow him anyway. 

I remember articles in the leftist press at the time of Trump's election, saying ""Hold your nose and vote for Hillary"". Literally. Even her supporters thought she was terrible. They weren't voting for her, they were voting against him. And many on the other side were doing the same.

"Trump supporters are hard pressed to pinpoint when America was great. Let me express an alternate view. America was at it's greatest after December 7th 1941 and until just after the Korean War. America was great when she was at common purpose with her allies and friends. With Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. Interestingly enough when she was aligned with the British Commonwealth of Nations. When America fell apart is when she started to believe her own propaganda, the greatest nation stuff that saw her want to do it alone for the wrong reasons. Be the defender of the free world and stand against communism without the expressed involvement of her allies, working partners. Desire for unshared status and glory hurt relationships in neighborhoods and among great nations. Even the most powerful nations erode internally as they shun external friends.

"Answer for the ignorants: ""From the very beginning of the country!""

and since this is a pathetic attempt at a gotcha, allow me to educate you: Slavery, colonialism, etc. were all WORLD WIDE INSTITUTIONS from time immemorial until 1776. Whether native tribes of the Americas, Africans (Zulu empire, for one), or East Asian (Khan Dynasty), or the middle east (don't get me started about the Ottomans),  this was the norm, not the exception. The USA *inherited* these institutions. Inherited. Read that word a few times if you need to. 

Rather than staying with the norms, The USA (and the west more broadly) were WAYYYY ahead of the curve in terms of abolitionism. And here is the kicker - it started with the declaration of independence and the constitution, to a lesser extent. The foundations of it literally began in the 18th century with significant progress in 1807 as President Jefferson banned the importation of slaves. 

If the notion is somehow that young America, in the middle of a war with a superpower, in the middle of creating a country from scratch should have ALSO banned slavery, an already embedded institution outright (rather than it being a gradual process), then you are not a serious human being.",2024-02-02 00:48:07,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.48141238,['en']

Trump Barbie: ""Um, I think a lot of it was lost when the Federal Reserve took over the money system.""

The U.S. Federal Reserve System was formed after a sequence of devastating financial crises set off by a series of bad banking decisions. These financial disasters were wreaking havoc on the fragile banking system, and had created a widespread public distrust of the private-sector banking system. The Federal Reserve System restored economic stability in the United States by introducing a central bank to oversee a safer, more flexible monetary policy.
Without the Federal Reserve System, we would be seeing structural and systemic policy choices made to favor only the richest and most powerful authoritarian oligarchs, leaving the majority of American people at an extreme economic and social disadvantage... hey, wait a minute!",2024-02-01 18:30:17,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.20705862,['en']

"You know what's great about channels like this, they interview possibly double digits to hundreds of people but they specifically handpick the few ones who are less informed about the specifics to show off in order to discredit the other side. 

Like the first guy, he's absolutely correct, the reason why it's hard to name a specific college is because a large number of high profile colleges are doing it so your head draws a blank when you're being asked in a public setting. 

A quick google search immediately brings up these colleges instantly ""Columbia University, Harvard University, Ohio State University, Illinois State University and the University of Texas at Austin""

And then right under that is immediately this ""Yale University, Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan will hold ceremonies for Asian and American Indian graduates"". 

Now be honest with yourself, can you genuinely remember the name of all these colleges when there's so many? It's like asking someone to immediately name all 50 states. A few might come to mind, but then you start to second guess yourself because you're on camera. Yale and Harvard are high profile examples, but you fear naming them because it doesn't seem like something a high-profile college should be doing. Yet they are. So then your mind goes to lesser colleges, but because they're lesser colleges, you can't remember their specific names.

On that note, notice how they only show white people for the most part? They want to tie in the image of trump supporters only being white.

"‚úì	\First, the Con Edison has failed to prove that Butler‚Äôs non-criminal consumption of a legal substance rose to the level of abuse or that Butler‚Äôs consumption of alcohol adversely affected his job performance or the public‚Äôs trust (whatever that is). Moreover, the only consequence of off-duty chemical substance abuse is that the employee will be sent for a JFE. Here, Butler was sent for a JFE on December 16, 2014 tested negative for drugs and alcohol.
	‚úì	On December 13, 2014, Butler was purported observed by Officer Brito moving from the driver‚Äôs seat to the passenger seat a couple of hundred yards from the DWI checkpoint. Officer Brito did not testify that Butler was driving erratically or displayed other indicia of someone that was driving while impaired. The Union concedes that Officer Brito‚Äôs assumption that Butler‚Äôs actions were to avoid being identified as either a driver who had been drinking or a driver who might not have had a valid license is reasonable. It is also reasonable for Officer Brito to assume that if he could see Butler then Butler could see him. That assumption is not reasonable.
¬†
	‚úì	Officer Brito also demonstrated his expertise and training in many facets of alcohol and drug testing but the only verified test result was the breathalyzer results. This is important because clearly Brito had an animus against Butler. Brito testified that Butler was quietly being difficult and when Brito was asked why he issued Butler a summons for refusing to test AFTER he submitted to a breathalyzer test Brito testified that Butler was walking out of the police station with a summons regardless. Butler was issued a summons that was so patently meritless that the Westchester District Attorney‚Äôs office did not even submit opposition to Butler‚Äôs motion to dismiss. (Union Exhibit ‚Äú2‚Äú)
¬†
	‚úì	The Union submits that Brito‚Äôs testimony is troubling. A police officer charged with upholding the law and who described himself as an expert in the observation of behavior under the influence of drugs and alcohol and who is also charged with knowledge of the NYS Vehicle and Traffic Law issued a summons that (based on his expertise) he had to know was invalid Brito practically admitted that since Butler gave him a hard time and wasted his time that night (because he did not engage in criminal conduct), he was going to give Butler a hard time. That hard time translated into the issuance of an invalid summons that forced Butler to retain counsel and utterly wasted the time of the Court that dismissed the summons that the Westchester County determined unworthy of opposition.

Americans can become great again, however....
Neither Trump nor Biden is going to bring the greatness back.

The only way to break the dark, unquestioning spell is for it to be shattered somehow shattered by disillusionment and loss of confidence.  however, trump's con man skills are his strongest suit.  Trump's supporters don't care about Operation Solar Wind or selling top secret documents to our enemies.  They don't see the harm in having Russian intelligence interfering in the 2016 election.  In fact, they loved it.  But look, it's impossible to drain the swamp when you ARE the swamp. Trump is in the deepening darkness - right up to his Hitler moustache - and he is planning on roaring back out of it like the tornado he is, wreaking a wider and fiercer path of destruction in his wake than ever before.  It's double down time for the Dems.  Using my trump playbook decoder I predict a second term with him will, by its end, leave what used to be America in smoking ruins.  Prophets have foretold trump.  He is a destroyer.  I think it's time we just admit it.",2024-02-01 14:29:42,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.45549932,['en']

"""Make America Great Again"" is merely a vague catchphrase meant to tap into people's sense of rose-tinted nostalgia for a bygone idealized time or era when things where supposedly better than they currently are, their feelings of resentment and impotence over their inability to stop the changes that have been occurring in the world around them, and the ultimately futile desire to somehow turn back the clock and forcibly revert the entire nation to that ""great"" time or era (all while ignoring that while it may have been great for them, it was probably pretty shitty for entire groups of people who aren't like them). 

And because it's so vague and loosely defined, those people can simply plug in whatever timeframe they personally find most desirable and beneficial for them. (Of course, this appeals more to the older people in an increasingly aging voter base, who actually have more of a past to be nostalgic for.) That's why you keep getting so many different answers (and non-answers) from these people. The phrase is practically a Rorschach test of cultural nostalgia. They all have their own ideas of when America was better, even in the instances when they can't give you a real reason why it was so much better or are completely misinformed about what made it better.",2024-02-01 10:33:44,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.17891699,['en']

"Here's the thing: Television is our window on the world.  So the impression one gets is of the broadcast vibe of one's youth when things seemed rosier, and these poitical actors could persuade people into believing in them, falling under the spell of their act, and that they were the mythical western hero coming to save them, like Ronald Reagan.  Kennedy really was great because he stood for the higher ideals that we aspire to as a people and for greater equality and justice.  He was of course a Democrat, and Trump is so far right of Kennedy as to be antithetical to what Kennedy stood for.  But we're looking at the vibe of the times with the power of media projection into the brain by Fox and others into traditional right wing families' minds.  One forgets about the frustration at corruption that many feel, an ever increasingly complex world, and a desire for simplicity.  Rhetoric sells even though Trump does either nothing or the opposite.  Drain the swamp, then who knows the swamp better than him, then nothing.  I can see that many Trump supporters are not bad people, but are pulled in by the desire for community, TV selling of the Donald to them (movie magic effect), and his ability to appeal to that 'fight back' mentality.  Rallies and stadium events build a kind of mass unity and consensus among supporters, and then trumpism becomes like a religion.  Some people prefer the 'fired up and charge ahead' stump speeches over sincere, sensible, and intelligent but low key leaders.  I can only hope we come back to our senses as a nation and understand and hold accountable the media organizations responsible for helping to instigate and lie to these citizens, which pulled them in.  The flaws in our system are becoming more and more apparent.  We have freedom of speech and of the press, but limited accountability for when thst press goads people into attacking the government trying to overturn an election.  It was a concerted effort, but given the power of TV broadcasting to persuade people in like what a movie does, and then what they planted into viewers minds, they bear responsibility just like Trump, and Bannon, and many others.  üóΩ ‚öñÔ∏èüá∫üá∏",2024-02-01 06:18:15,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.06104896,['en']

"America was the greatest nation in the world  before the Europeans came here illegally. Now the offspring of those illegal Europeans don't want others to come here. How racist of them.
 Are white people naturally racist? No. Nobody is born a racist. Racism is mostly taught at home.  Every race complains about the other people. I remember when white people hated Italians. Then they hated the black people, then around WWII they hated orientals, then they started hating middle easterners, and now they hate Hispanics. 

Hate and racism are part of the white people culture.
As an mixed blooded Hispanic-Native American I know to well what racism looks like.
I once had a racist white nationalist neighbor that showed his disdain for other races. But when  his eldest daughters married a handsome black man, (he didn't attend the wedding) and had black baby children from 
that black man the racist father's racism began to disappear. 
This man's friends looked at him as a changed person when he was carrying his beautiful black granddaughter in his arms. We made eye contact and he raised his head as to say ""hi I'm not racist anymore and I'm  sorry about my past behavior.""

"@mmmkayultra calm and articulate aren't synonyms for sane and  intelligent.
1.  If you're unhappy with the way a University chooses to hold its commencements, take it up with the University. They have their own governing bodies that decide those issues. They aren't being hashed out on the House floor. 
2. I can't even with her. JFK was a Catholic Democrat whose world views were polar opposite of 45s. However, she may have linked them together based upon the ""many rumors"" claiming their extramarital affairs... In which case she would have been way better off not using that comparison. üòÇ
3. ""Pulling yourself up by your bootstrap"" sounds good and all until you remember that those boot pullers had loads of government assistance that is routinely overlooked. GI Bill, anyone? Not to mention, trickle down economics was a HUGE FAILURE.
4. Someone needs to tell her that her complaint about how the Federal Reserve operates and her ideal scenario are the exact same things.
5. The year that our country was established? No. And I'm not even giving an explanation because nobody was enjoying themselves then! Or maybe in the midst of slavery, The Civil War, Reconstruction? Definitely not.

"I do think the Trumpers aren't wrong when they think our best years are behind us.  I think that too.  But we can't go back in time, and a lot of the ways things are different now are not necessarily things that have a political solution, or ones that a president can solve.  Yes, we are declining on the world stage.  A lot of that has to do with other countries simply growing their economy, and putting education first, like China, South Korea etc.  I think the world is more dangerous and the future more uncertain, but that will only become worse by weakening ties with our historical NATO allies, becoming closer to Russia, and denying that climate change exists or that we should do anything about it.  I think the Trumpers' focus on immigration being the source of their problems is misplaced.  They say they espouse the hard work ethos and pulling oneself up by the bootstraps.  I don't disagree (though I still feel the richest country on the planet should take care of its own people in poor hardship), but I would also say that most immigrants I see DO live that ethos--they don't feel entitled to free services, they do work hard, and most of them do try to adjust to the culture.  Of course it is always hard for the first generation to learn a new language and assimilate, but that was the same for the Irish, Italian, German, Polish etc. immigrants too.  Their kids assimilated, and now we appreciate all those blended cultures we came from.  I don't see anything different with the Central American immigrants.  My wife is of Mexican descent, but also a proud American.  Her grandparents worked very hard and were part of the community in a small Ohio town--they speak Spanish and accented English, we ate tamales and menudo and mole at their house, but they were also proud to be American.",2024-01-31 22:41:48,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.06817148,['en']

"What was great about America:

What our country has lost and needs to get back:
Most people are smart enough to know what it means but for political purposes  fake ignorance. 
*The good things about this country that have been destroyed and that some people refuse to see or acknowledge are long and I don't have time to elaborate further:
*I want Socialism and communism to be viewed as it used to be: a bad thing. 
*I want the media to be objective and not an arm of the DNC.
*I want the negative¬†effects of the  Cultural Revolutions of the 1960‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs to be reversed: abortion, recreational drug use, the virulent anti-Christian agenda of the left to be pushed back.  And moral relativism to no longer be viewed as though it is of legitimate value.  
*I want political correctness eradicated. 
*I want education to be localized and socialism no longer taught as though it is a good thing. 
*I want patriotism to be respected not be bashed as though it is a bad thing. 
*I want an economy that is strong and based on market capitalism. 
*I want taxation to be reduced to previous levels. 
*I want the government to be small, like it used to be and not intrusive or surveilling its citizens. 
*I want social relief to be of a private nature like it used to be. 

No I don't want the things the Democratic Party has stood for such as slavery, bigotry or Jim Crow.

"Edward Bernays was the architect of propaganda. That's why we have the mess we currently have. But they don't teach kids the truth, they teach them a load of propaganda.
In order for a country to be ""great _again""_ that implies that it would've been ""great"" previously. Do these folks know that this nation was stolen from Indigenous Americans? How ""great"" was that? Manifest destiny was equally as wrong as slavery was, and the two ran hand in hand. Now if you define ""great"" as massive in area, then I suppose it could be argued that our country is ""great"" in area, area that was stolen from its rightful inhabitants. But we've all been fed lies from day one. The kids are taught lies in the schools and in the churches, wth a few measly grains of truth mixed in here and there, and the modern corporate robber barons buy and sell congressfolks as if they were racehorses. Money is the great motivator, and money is just worthless paper with some numbers on it. It's supposedly worth what _they_ say it's worth, but it's fiat currency. They just keep printing more of it with nothing to back it but the sweat of the working class. They consider us all as livestock, workhorses, minions to do their bidding, and it's all the work of Edward Bernays. He was a manipulator of lies, you could even call him the master of lies, or the father of lies. The 1% hired him to spin a yarn in their favor, and now we're suffering the lingering effects of his lies. POTUS is just a puppet that gets propped up in front of the cameras. The ones that really run this dog and pony show are hiding behind the curtain, in their underground bunkers. I don't know how we can defeat them at this late stage of the game. They've got us all bent over the picnic table, giving us the shaft, without any lube, or even a reach around. And sheeple don't have a clue. I'm old, I'm gonna die someday, and then our kids and grandkids will be left holding the bag. Our 7th & 8th graders can't even read at a 4th grade level, but they can sure Tiktok. Israel is treating the Palestinians the same way the nazis treated the Jews. Putin is an unstable megalomaniac, just like Kim Jong Un, and several _other_ despotic heads of state and/or _wannabe_ heads of state who shall remain nameless...

What does the ""again"" mean... It means the way it is NOT now. America was becoming greater than its been in decades under President Donald Trump. It is NOT that now under Biden. It is degrading day by day into something citizens here do not recognize. 
Make America great AGAIN means bring it back in a direction toward greatness, not toward constantly increasing fuel prices which drives up the price of everything, it means NOT withdrawing from Afghanistan too early and leaving American military, billions in tech and munitions in the hands of the Taliban, NOT dismantling the Keystone Pipeline the first day in office putting 11,000 people on unemployment and putting us further and further from energy independence. Great AGAIN  means NOT allowing the border crisis to continue running out of control, allowing record numbers of illegals (over 302,000 in December alone). 
""AGAIN"" means when we have a country ONCE AGAIN that is not allowing the above to happen, and is doing SOMETHING... ANYTHING to correct those issues, which at the moment, under Biden, it is not.

Food was abundant, most goods and services were sourced localy.  Cheap goods from other countries were not sold as premium brands.  Oh yes, America was great at one time, but thanks to Liberals and Progressives its now just an average shithole like what they've done to Europe.

"My guess is ‚Ä¶ Republicans NOW in office will be lining up behind Donald Trump as the ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù person to become the next President. 

And the reason for that behavior, is that they are terrified of Donald Trump. And rightly so, because they witnessed from past experiences how Donald‚Äôs nature is to be very cruel to those that dare to cross him. 

When Donald was first running for the office of the President, many Republicans were laughing at him. But they didn't realize the gullibility of the citizens that were enthralled by Donald's ""blustery ability to charm others with his countless lies."" 

Many Republicans were fired by Donald when he was in office, for not towing Donald's ""LINES"" ‚Ä¶ while others had their reputations destroyed by his ability to be downright cruel. 

And other Republicans that had been in office just simply gave up and quit in exasperation. 

If I was a Republican now in office ... I also would be terrified to cross Donald ... just in case people are still gullible enough to vote him back in as the next President ... and this time to watch him complete the job of overthrowing the government and becoming the first DICTATOR to destroy the United States SUPREME COURT ... and ... what used to be a government for the people. 

If Donald wins ... it will no longer BE the United States governing the citizens. It will be Donald Trump governing all citizens ... in offices and not in offices ...as Donald will keep on USING people as nothing other than a means to his own ends. 

Vladimir Putin would be ecstatic if Donald were to win ‚Ä¶ because he knows that Donald looks UP to him as his IDOL ... while not realizing that Vladimir is much more experienced and cunning than ever could be ...

"I don't cheer for anyone politically so I am not on either side of all of this. In terms of the question I feel like it's hard question to answer in a graceful way.

Asking that question would be similar to going up to a football team and saying ""when was football great"". Everyone will have a different answer and many will have a hard time answering that on the spot without having some time to think. Some people will argue about the availability of technology making games easier to view in modern days. Some people will see past days as being better for whatever reasons (past heroes who carved the way, better coaching, whatever). At the end of the day there are good and bad things that happen in each segment of time.

I think the message ""America great again"" is more about the idea of pursuing desired qualities that we have in our history. Probably qualities that I think we all want from each other like trust and honesty. Maybe there was a time when we once had more trust? Our founding fathers gave blood and sacrifice for our country and our freedoms. That leads you to believe that at least in the opening days some levels of trust and honesty with our leadership were there. The idea of the quote is probably coming from something along those lines: the idea of looking at our history and taking some of the qualities that were good/desirable as we take steps into our future. 

No one is perfect and this political stuff is crazy as usual but I think we can all agree that trust and honesty (accountability, organization, conciseness (no bs), etc.) would be nice qualities to see in our leaders.  

On another note, I am not mad or annoyed at your video but I didn't watch any of it. No matter what clips you edited in there, I think that creating divide and dramatic events is a distraction from focusing on creating togetherness and getting the jobs done that we need to do to improve our lives in our country. It's hard to believe it sometimes these days when bad things happen but we are all in this together so we should try to remember that.",2024-01-31 18:22:21,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.03109552,['en']

"The answer is simple. America was great in the late 90s early 2000s. Before the left went to the extreme. Back Before it was ""cool"" to be gay. Back when a mans word meant something. Back when it was good to be a masculine man and a feminine woman with real gender roles. Back when Americans were on the same page and people were proud to be Americans. The left and its ideologies have run thid country into the ground. Now that they have America face first in the dirt they continue to kick us while we are down. They've opened the borders so our small towns and big cities are being over run by illegals. They have made us wimps in the eyes of the world. Its why putin has been able to get away with what he has. They used covid as an excuse to over run a free and fair election with mail in votes. Our country has gone to hell in a hand basket because of these people. How you all can be so blind to it beats me. Which most of the left in control or who have money arent blind to it. They want it. They want our country divided. When the population is divided everything fails. Just like it has for the last decade. Trump was just a glimer of hope that things might be changing and possibly could have if the election hadn't been stolen. 8 years with trump in office being allowed to do his job would have guaranteed a conservative in the white house for the next 8-12 years at minimum. However the left couldn't stand him. Lied about him. Tried to run him in the ground but failed.

"The US has been down this road several times before.  Radical leftism -- which is ideologically incompatible with Americanism -- has been a strident force in America since Lenin supplanted the Menshevik Revolution in Russia.  But we have held it together through each test.

However, the main difference now is that the institutions and media have joined forces to give the leftist mindset broader range and longevity.  It has become entrenched and isolated.  

It's the type of self-perpetuating liberalism that Friedrich Nietzsche warned would ultimately destroy progressive civilizations in the latter half of this century.  Civilizations, he figured, that would not stand up for themselves under the weight of their self-imposed rectitude and ultra-moralist worldview.

America was better when it had rule of law.  Lefties don't want rule of law.  Has anyone ever asked why the biden administration is violating the law by inviting millions of people to come into this country illegally?  I'll give you a hint, it's not because he loves them or us.  It's because corporate interests want them here to depress wages. That's it pure and simple.  The American people won't stand for that many people to come here legally so they're doing it this way which is even better for politicians because they can use your money to provide services for these people and they have these illeagal immigrants by the balls.  It's a win win for the powers that be.

The biggest problem that you have caused is unrestrained government.  Instead of demanding that the government be held to a high standard and be forced to follow the constitution you have allowed the government to become a bunch of crooks.  I suggest that you start getting your heads out from where the sun don't shine and give the government a good smack to the face. You can start by voting for people who believe in solid values and if you don't know what that means google it or don't vote.  Most people aren't qualified to vote anyway.

So let me phrase it better, when did you feel like living in America was at its greatest? My answer, 2016.

"The Democrats began their ""War on Poverty"" in January of 1965 with NO INTENTION of reducing poverty.  Their intention was, and is, to keep the poor and minorities mired in poverty and voting for their promises of government assistance from a government that's over $34 trillion in debt and wasting over $717 billion for interest on the debt before it can spend one cent on education, healthcare, or anything else.  And that doesn't include the unfunded liability for Social Security and Medicare.  Both political parties accuse the other of raiding the Social Security Superfund.  The truth is there is no Superfund.  The money that people receive for Social Security is drawn from the money that those people who are still working are paying in.  Doesn't that sound like what Bernie Madoff was doing to investors?  Isn't that what's called a Ponzi Scheme?  Wake Up!!

"A lot of it has to do with a backlash to modern social justice movements making certain demographics feel inadequate or guilty, such as the ""conservative, Christian, white male"" mentioned by the first interviewee. A lot of people misinterpret the goals of social justice movements such as feminism and feel under attack, which Trump exploits - his messaging plays on that feeling of being threatened and needing to fight back. This allows people to flip their feeling of guilt into a belief that they are victims of discrimination. So the ""again"" part is an appeal to the nostalgia of certain people who long to return to a time before they had to grapple with the reality of social hierarchies, a time before pesky civil rights activists started making life a bit more complicated for the average Joe.",2024-01-31 01:49:50,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.19599396,['en']

YOU?

""FARMERS NEED TO PAY MORE!  THEN 'REAL AMERICANS' WILL DO THOSE JOBS!""

JUST ASK THE GUY IN CALIFORNIA WHO GROWS GRAPES.  YOU DIC*S KEPT CALLING ICE TO HAVE HIS WORKERS DEPORTED SO HIS WORKERS STOPPED COMING TO WORK OUT OF FEAR THEY'D BE NAILED.

HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ADVERTISE $25 AN HOUR FOR PICKING THE GRAPES.

SO, WHAT WILL YOU NOW SAY WHEN YOU CLOSE THE BORDER, KICK OUT ALL THE MIGRANTS AND ILLEGALS, AND NOW WE ALL GET TO PAY $25 FOR A F'ING HEAD OF LETTUCE AND $30 FOR A BAG OF APPLES?  OF COURSE, THAT'S ASSUMING YOU CAN EVEN FIND LETTUCE OR APPLES BECAUSE, WITHOUT THE PEOPLE WILLING TO DO THOSE JOBS, THE PRODUCE IS ROTTING IN THE FIELDS.

"I'll have a crack:
America was great when it upheld true religious freedoms for all & conservative Christians were not frowned upon. When it had true racial equality that it fought so hard for from the 30's onwards. When all lives mattered & not just black lives. When it celebrated the differences between the sexes & protected females by not allowing born males to compete against them in sport. When it didn't teach 'critical race theory' to toddlers, when it didn't push the notion that its ok to push puberty blockers & to have gender reassigning surgery for young teenagers. When it was in control of its borders. When blacks & Hispanics had the lowset unemployment rates in the history of the country. When they had a presidents that could actually formulate a sentence & express themselves eloquently. When the tyrants of the world actually respected America that they thought twice before committing atrocities. ""when was America Great"" you ask? During Trump's first term.
That's just a start. & I'm not American. I'm Australian & I want America to be great again.",2024-01-30 20:00:29,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.24603334,['en']

The first was the invasion of Iraq, motivated by fear, ignorance, and a need to be seen to be tough at a time when the public demanded it.
The second was the election of a narcissistic imbecile over a highly qualified female candidate who would have made an excellent first female president because of ""e-mails"".

"When was America Great?  America was great even before it was America, when it was just a dream.  The men and women of this country stood up together and fought against a common enemy, we won, and our great nation was born!   Another time America was exceptionally great is when the Republican President Abraham Lincoln, with a nation at war with itself, set slaves free.  The nation was stronger than the war and grew together, stronger than before.   This lead to the Republicans being able to pass an amendment giving black Americans the right to vote.  The Republicans also passed the amendment to give women the right to vote.  Both of the previous amendments were fought against by the Democrats.  Yet another time America was exceptionally great is when the world was at war for a 2nd time, the majority of able bodied men were away fighting and the women kept the nation strong and productive.  All Americans worked for the better good of the nation and the world. ¬†

America is greatest when we all come together as a nation for the betterment of the country.

Multiple times I used the phrase ""exceptionally great"" because I love my country and there has been dark times as well as great and even better...exceptionally great times.  Although we are not perfect (USA), we are the best country on the planet.  We are the most tolerant, we are the country that helps every other country whether they like us or not.  We are the country that pays or gives the most financial aid to other countries.  The world relies and counts on the USA for protection and leadership whether they admit it or not.  Let's all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

"Trump brought inflation down? Christ, how much of the Kool-Aid are these people drinking?
Inflation rate in 2013: 1.5%
Inflation rate in 2014: 0.8%
Inflation rate in 2015: 0.7%
Inflation rate in 2016: 2.1% (trump elected)
Inflation rate in 2017: 2.1%
Inflation rate in 2018: 1.9%
Inflation rate in 2019: 2.3%

Inflation went UP under trump, NOT DOWN (even before the pandemic came along and screwed with all of it).
Like there is actual data--measurable, demonstrable numbers--and everything!

They're living in a fantasy world where they just make stuff up--or hear some right wing talk show host say it--and just blindly swallow it down and believe it to be true. Inflation literally doubles in trump's first 3 years compared to Obama's last term. Total American household debt load climbed ~16.5% in just 3 years, from roughly $12.2T in late 2016 to $14.2T in Q4 of 2019. The number of people working multiple jobs went up under trump. The U.S. trade deficit was -446B (2013), -484B (2014), -491B (2015), and -481B (2016) under Obama, but immediately climbed to -513B (2017), -579B (2018), and -576B (2019) under trump. Job creation didn't stop under trump (until the pandemic), but was more anemic than under Obama, with Obama setting a presidential record 76 straight months of job growth when he left office. Heck, that last guy was a farmer and farm income went DOWN under trump, averaging nearly $446B per year in Obama's final term to only $425B per year under trump's pre-pandemic time in office. 

Their lives got worse and they're CONVINCED it got better. I WISH I had the ability to lie to myself this hard. It would make so many things a lot easier.

The things that Trump says about others that you love and laugh at?  Are the very things he says about YOU... when you aren't around to hear it.  In the end everyone with this disorder betrays every loyal good honest person who helped get them there. I mean everyone.

 The Foundation of the now famous Trump disorder is that he's out for himself alone. In the end everybody else will suffer for supporting him and trying to advance themselves by using him and a relationship with him. It will take a while because you are the last Power Trip but it will come. No exceptions. First he will beat them and you will cheer. And then he will be you and you will suffer shock and betrayal as you have never known. He will beat you and he will WIN. 

Those with his disorder truly are on autopilot and it's disgusting that no one helps him medically. Those with his disorder consider those who are loyal and supportive to be stupid to believe the fairy tales and those loyalists are despised and mocked in private. Every narcissist ever does this.

 The majority of my adult life was spent in the Republican Party getting my news from Fox before these other greedy Outlets popped up. We have a problem with news organizations and profit right now because Integrity isn't running the show anymore. We have the same problem in politics. Don't you realize that Trump is now The Insider you feared! Did you see who he appointed in his cabinet? After the originals were fired? I don't think you've spent enough time stepping back and thinking about what is going on here. There's no God in this because there's no love and God doesn't care one wink about government it means nothing as Jesus Paid the taxes from the fish's coin. Just please be careful leaning too hard in on this thing. If you want a strong dictator type there are plenty of countries to choose from. That is not this country and my parents and grandparents fought too hard to keep this democracy as flawed as it is. It's still better than the other government forms. Anyone saying that Trump is okay being a dictator knows nothing about the history of the German people and would benefit greatly. One of the greatest deceptions, at least until this era. You get to support anyone you want and you get to vote for anyone you want to. Just please remember this post if you ever see something to make you question the gap between what he says and who he actually benefits the most. If you are alter Rich then good for you and you would love him.

Dig into his background a little if you think you know this guy because you don't. I didn't. But I know now because I took the time to look. I hope you will be brave enough to challenge yourself and take a look yourself at who you are actually dealing with instead of what he says he is. This is no game. This is the future for our grandchildren. God told us how to discern the tricksters is by the fruits of what they do and if they love people. All people.

"This is nuts, they have all these freedoms now!  The problem is they don't respect other peoples' rights to their freedoms, which is why the laws they resent were put into place, to attempt to create a more equal playing field for everyone, by preventing bigotry, race or religious prejudice that was more common in Leave-it-to-Beaver years.  They resent that other people might want the freedom to live a different way than them, and that their right to have unlimited access to any gun should be regulated in favor of everyone else's right to being alive.  It's astonishing that someone else's life - a LIFE - is less important to them than that gun, that THING they fight so hard to hang onto.  They resent laws that protect other peoples' rights to worship as they please, to speak in their own language; to marry who they want and divorce if they want; to shop, live, work or exercise wherever they want; to dress as they want; make their own choice about if, when and how many children to have; read what books they want and which movies to watch; and where to get an education.  This group of people does not want to compromise.  They cannot conceive of or want a win-win world, which is why Donald Trump's win-lose attitude appeals to them.

"If these people knew the answer to this most obvious of questions, they could articulate it without stammering and tripping over their own words. Don't they think about that every time they put the hat on? The first and only time I ever heard it said or implied that America wasn't great was from Trump. He's the one who got delusional people to buy into the notion that America wasn't great. I talk to people around the world via work that I do and never once in over 50 years have I heard that America wasn't anything but great, wonderful, idealist and the list goes on. What Trump has been dumping on us is an old sales tactic called, ""Make sick, make well"". The pitch is to convince the buyer how bad off they are, and that the seller's product is the only one that will make them better [off].¬†


Winston Churchill wrote, ‚ÄúThose that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.‚Äù This comment is so applicable to our time more than ever. Consider two divisive party philosophies of the Republicans and the Democrats: The Republicans are very quick to make a point that anyone left of center (or anyone outside of the GOP) are socialists and communists. In their minds, it's the GOP way or no way, never mind that a great number of Americans fall around the middle somewhere. We've all heard rhetoric like this coming from them, it's no secret. I can't recall at any point in my adult life when I heard Democrats shelling the GOP with such hate speech.¬† Just look at Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert: these two are so full of vitriol the likes of which I've not heard in 50+ years as a registered voter; and these two are hardly alone in the GOP. If the Democrats being on the left of center are well, Democrats, liberals, socialists and ultimately communists (according to pundits), where then do the GOP fall?? Let's see, moving to the right of center there are Republicans, conservatives, right-wingers, die-hard conservatives..., eventually we arrive at fascists then Nazi. Go ahead, open your history books and figure it out. Turn back the clock to Germany in the 1930's, the rise of Fascism in the party of Adoph Hitler, the Nazis. Italy soon followed. Anyone not of their liking was belittled, hated, imprisoned and exterminated. There was rioting in the streets leading up to Hitler's rise to power which ultimately resulted in the suspension of their constitution. A dictatorship. Sound familiar? Sounds like our January 6th with he who would be king egging them on, just like Hitler. If you can't win the votes of the people, take it away!

I registered as a Republican when Nixon was dragging us through Watergate. I still joined the GOP with the hope that this was just a momentary hiccup in politics. In the years since I've come to see the GOP has become the party of hate, and so many GOP leaders jumping onto the wagon of hate just to stay in office, to remain relevant to keep their power and influence. This is not patriotism, it's called corruption.",2024-01-30 04:15:06,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.21776234,['en']

That was in the 60s.  Of course my parents said yes. But not all did.   America has never bin great. It's better then communist countries and seems great for that.

"2:40: she tries to appear so knowledgeable and wise.

Here's the facts:
FMOC (Federal Open Market Committee) aka ""The Fed"" was first convened in 1933, following the Glass-Steagall Act; but the FOMC as we know it today was convened in 1936 as constituted by Section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act as amended by the Banking Act of 1935.

Roosevelt departed from the gold standard by 1932, when the gold standard had been abandoned as a global monetary system.

At the end of WWII, the U.S. had 75% of the world's monetary gold and the dollar was the only currency still backed directly by gold.¬†However, as the world rebuilt itself after WWII, the U.S. saw its gold reserves steadily drop as money flowed to war-torn nations and its own high demand for imports. The high inflationary environment of the late 1960s sucked out the last bit of air from the gold standard.¬†

The Gold Pool collapsed in 1968 (recall Vietnam War) as member nations were reluctant to cooperate fully in maintaining the market price at the U.S. price of gold.

The U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1971 to curb inflation and prevent foreign nations from overburdening the system by redeeming their dollars for gold.",2024-01-30 02:43:50,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.054037213,['en']

Keep the public uneducated and you can treat then like mushrooms.   Within a short while of independence the US was at war with all of it's neighbours based on outright lies.  Spain they said blew up the USS Maine, proven lie.  The war of 1812 they claimed the British was taking US sailors from US ships.  Truth was they were taking Royal Navy sailors who had gone awol and still had time on their papers.  The US navy never should have taken any sailor on board who had commitments to other navies left to serve.   To this day the US still tracks down awol service men and women.  Then with Mexico the US grabbed land that was not theirs.  This set the standard for US land grabs all over the world but it told everyone they were not an empire.

"Absolute delusions. The average American has never found America to be a great place for success. We are heavily taxed on income, product sales, and point-of-sale. Then, quite often, we pay to have our waste 'taken care of' by private companies (that just bury it in the dirt, so they can later dig it up and sell it when resources are scarce), private companies for death coverage (insurance), private companies for loans (Coinage Act of 1792 is still in effect, managing gold-to-silver value; loans should be to the Treasury at 0% interest), and a slew of other ridiculous things that shout ""WE ARE NOT FREE!""

We have never been free. The elitist factions of Europe came to the United States to build new fortunes and new Empire. This is a continuation of the Old Empire, the British Empire; the elite powers that came here used We, the People, to fight other aristocrats for their feifdoms, the colonies. We never fought a war for We, the People; we fought a war for American Aristocracy; we went right into slavery, indentured servitude, and low-income poverty right afterwards. Yes there were entrepreneurs, but they were the few lucky rare ones. That ratio still exists today.

This country and it's 'virtues' are a sham. We espouse our love of freedom and rights, but DENY THOSE RIGHTS TO OTHERS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AMERICAN CITIZENS. That is NOT how the spirit of being American should be; we committed a MAJOR genocide to create this country, and our atonement should be to raise up and liberate people from tyranny anywhere there is tyranny.

And yes, I support a land repatriation and treaty convention on American Natives vs US government. It is a long-standing issue and must be addressed. It is likely why the US doesn't want a Palestinian state: It opens the doors for the dozens of American Native tribes to file suit against the United States, or someone to do it for them.",2024-01-29 11:34:06,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.17198499,['en']

"I like the whole ""let's keep the invaders out"" thing. I wonder what indigenous Americans would think of that?

If they had no sympathy about how their ancestors, as invaders, treated the locals, the why should anyone care about how these 'soft-cocks"" crying and whining hysterically over an alleged ""invasion"" of a few refugees and asylum seekers? They whine and cry about a totally imaginary American far left, seeing no difference between AOC and Joe Stalin, or a difference between Joe Biden and the late and not lamented Joseph Stalin. 
They don't accept any science that does not suit them. Nukes are Ok, because they can rid the world of Communists, other cultures, science, history, and really anyone who does not agree with their fairy-tale ""perception"" of reality. Biology? Nope. They don't actually know any biology, or how it works, but they are ""certain"" that binary sex is a thing. It gives them an excuse to hate on LBGTQI folks. And they can't even tell the difference between sex and gender. And as for evolutionary biology, they hate and deny that with a passion, because it pokes big holes in their creator-god fairy-tale. 
And the vast majority don't even understand basic theology.  Or details of the holy book that they are supposed to revere. Most haven't read it, and the few that have, have read nothing else. 
So an omniscient, all-loving creator-god right? The origin of everything.  Which means he created LBGTQI folks too. Yet you want to believe he created them so that you could have something to hate? How does that work? Your infinitely ""good"" god. He just made them as ""toys"" for you to play with? I suppose that is why y'all are cool with slavery? 
And absolutely no concept of freedom, rights and special privilege. None. If you DID actually had a clue, you would not think that the increasingly fascist ""interpretations"" of the 2nd was a good thing.
And please, stop with the ""Christians being persecuted thing"".  A strange thing freedom of religion. That actually means that people can subscribe to any religious creed, and positions like atheism and agnosticism.

Also that lady who loved Reagan seemed to have forgotten how his cut backs on bank regulations and their subsequent loose lending policies blew up the economy & housing markets in Reagan‚Äôs 7th yr with a housing collapse so large that the Federal Gov had to step in and close over 1,000+ banks and create a separate agency ( RTC) to take over and try to sell bank assets ( residential & commercial loans, foreclosed houses $ buildings by the thousands) at fire sale prices.

"""Google it"" is always the response when they realize their argument is flawed. If you then follow up and ask for what websites you should search to find their supporting facts they cannot provide a citation. Lets be very clear I believe these people are victims of a very well orchestrated propaganda campaign. There are hundreds of misinformation websites with ""private"" registration so you cannot identify the owners. BUT if you know the tricks you will find that these misinformation sites are often owned by a handful of corporate entities (again concealment). You will find, for example a site espousing a specific narrative has over one hundred other sites of similar name or theme, owned by the same business entity. The content is of the same misinformation narrative often down to the paragraph. So if a person were to search they would find many sites supporting the same false claim. It is insidious. Note also than many of these sites are web hosted and registered out of the US even if the corporation responsible is within the borders. This creates jurisdictional isolation - another layer of opacity. It is also possible that one or more shell companies are involved for further isolation. So until this attack on the minds of these individuals is fully exposed you are treating the symptoms, not the disease.  The other very important question is WHY they feel this is true. What underlying issue in their daily life is actually the Achilles Heal that this attack succeeds in hitting.",2024-01-28 23:39:13,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.103928015,['en']

"In the history of our country, The United States of America. Each time we let too many republikkklans have a seat in government, the economy just gets destroyed by their stupid ideas. The GOP is the worst enemy the American people have ever had.

Between the Republican Great Depression of 1929-1937 and Reagan's inauguration in 1981, the United States experienced a few recessions, but nothing as severe as Republican President Herbert Hoover oversaw back on Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929.

Hoover's crash was set up by the election of 1920, when Republican Warren Harding convinced Americans to abandon the trust-busting, high tax, progressive policies of Presidents Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson in favor of that generation's version of neoliberalism or what we today call Reaganomics.

Harding referred to it as ""Horse and Sparrow Economics"" ‚Äî it was the early 20th century version of what Reagan later reinvented as ""trickle-down economics.""
If the horses (rich people and big business) were fed more oats (through deregulation and tax cuts), more of those oats would pass undigested into the horse manure that then littered the streets of American. The sparrows (working class Americans) could then pick the extra oats out of the manure.

In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of ""more industry in government, less government in industry"" ‚Äî privatize and deregulate ‚Äî and ""a return to normality,"" his promise to drop the top tax bracket from its then-91 percent rate down to 25 percent.

Harding kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring '20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like ""the right to work"" to describe a union-free nation.
In the end, the result of the ""horses and sparrows"" economics advocated by Harding was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II).

FDR's response to Hoover's Depression was to raise the top income tax bracket back up to 91% and impose stiff regulations on banks and Wall Street, creating the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and putting Joe Kennedy in charge of it.

Gloria Swanson, who knew Kennedy well and intensely disliked him (he'd robbed and exploited her), told me over one of our many dinners in her New York apartment that FDR knew, ""It takes a crook to catch a crook."" And FDR was going after the crooks.
High taxes on the morbidly rich and aggressive government enforcement of banking and securities rules prevented another large-scale crash for a half century until Reagan came all High on oil and repeated Harding's mistakes in the 1980s.

After Reagan finally dropped the top tax rate from the 74% he inherited when he came into office to 28% there was a one-day 22% stock market crash ‚Äî Black Monday on October 27, 1987 ‚Äî that rivaled 1929's Black Tuesday for the first time.

When Reagan deregulated the Savings & Loan industry the banksters stole so much money they crashed S&Ls across America, the first serious bank panic since the Republican Great Depression.

We're still living in Reagan's neoliberal deregulated economy. It brought us two financial crises while he was President, the dot-com bubble-bust of 1999/2000, the Bush Crash of 2008, and arguably the 7.8 trillion-dollar-heist of 2020 when Trump passed out money to his fat-cat buddies without controls (we're still trying to figure out where all that money went).

Now, if Dimon is right, hang onto your hat for another ""event.""

The core tenant of both Harding's and Reagan's versions of neoliberalism is that the economy is essentially a force of nature. It's why Harding did away with regulations on stock speculation and why Reagan deregulated everything he could as fast as he could.

The economy ""operates according to its own rules,"" they'd tell you, and anything government does to interfere with it will simply produce a bad outcome.
In actual fact, the opposite is true.

Players in the top reaches of finance, banking, and speculation are much like players in boxing or football: they're engaged in a competitive high-stakes game defined by very specific rules, and when they know they can get away with breaking those rules, they'll often do it.

The difference is that instead of winning or throwing a football game or boxing match, when bankers and speculators violate the rules they can take down the entire economy.

The financial speculators, of course are rarely injured in the process. We bailed out the banksters and speculators in the 1980s, 1999/2000, 2008, and 2020 to the tune of trillions of dollars. Senior executives and shareholders took home hundreds of billions of those dollars, looting the system they themselves had crashed.
Since 2008, most of that money was created out of thin air by the Fed. Now the Fed wants it back, but the banksters and speculators have already stashed it in their offshore tax havens. As a result, working class Americans and small- and medium-sized businesses will largely foot the bill.

Dimon and the purveyors of doom may be wrong about a crisis at this particular moment, but the system is still shaky and fraud is rife across banking, brokerage and finance, as Elizabeth Warren and Katie Porter continually remind us.

As in The Hidden History of Neoliberalism: How Reaganism Gutted America, it's probably going to take another 1929-type event to shake Americans up enough to reject Reagan's vision of a deregulated economy and put the nation back on the course of the stable and steady Keynesian growth that FDR gave us from 1933 to 1981.
Now, in addition to an economy held together with the baling-wire of Fed stimulus (that's coming to an end), both the US and the world are facing a wild spectrum of assaults that could have huge economic impacts.

And Republicans are committed to doing everything they can to cripple our economy, refusing to pass much of Biden's economic agenda, in their belief that a Crash will help them in the 2022 and 2024 elections.",2024-01-28 23:33:33,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.4269174,['en']

"""These problems didn't exist when I was young"" almost always means one of four things:

1) They did exist, you just didn't know about them because there was no Internet, because the media didn't report on them or you didn't consume the media that did and the problem was hushed up in society. So all that is being demanded here is to finally be allowed to become ignorant again, which also explains the increase in conspiracy supporters and flatearthers. These people are like toddlers who stick their fingers in their ears and want to claim a political right to do so.

2) The problem didn't exist because the world was a completely different place. But the world will never be the same again, no policy in the world can turn back the clock. Global warming, for example, was not a problem, but only because the consequences back then were so small that only scientists could measure them, whereas today everyone can see them with the naked eye. These problems are not going away, you can fight them, but ignoring them is like ignoring gravity. Gravity doesn't care if you believe in it, you will still have to deal with its consequences.

3) The problem didn't exist because it was created by eliminating a much worse problem. Of course you could turn the whole thing around again to get rid of the current problem, but then you get the massive problem back. But these people don't understand that because they are too ignorant to understand the context, because they wouldn't want the big problem back either.

4) The problem didn't exist because certain parts of the population were oppressed or had no rights or were wrongly put in psychiatric wards or wrongly imprisoned. Of course, for some people it would solve their problems if people here were deprived of their rights again and treated like third-class citizens, but that is just completely out of the question.",2024-01-28 22:34:20,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.3245134,['en']

"Wow with each one of these people they had a real hard time trying to answer the basis question.  And the answer was either incomplete or just so off the wall that it made no sense.  The question is really complex because in each 100 years or so you had good times and bad times, so if you had to start at the beginning you would have to remind people that the founding fathers decided that a new country will be formed due to their belief that they didn‚Äôt want a ruler such as a King or Queen to tell them what to do, so they left their homeland in search of a better life.  But what they didn‚Äôt realize that when they landed here there were humans already living here.  So instead of trying to work with them to have some kind of shared existence, they decided to kill the Natives you lived here, and the ones who were left behind were forced to walk to their deaths in a event called the trail of tears.  And that was put in place by then President Andrew Jackson.   Keep in mind that any and all treaties that were drafted with the Natives were reneged by the early States so that happened.  Then we move a little forward on to the times when the country wasn‚Äôt great.  That‚Äôs when it brought captured Africans aside the ones who came with the first settlers, in chains from Africa and the West Indies.  The forced labor they had to endure helped finance the country which made it grow in terms of industry and power it gained from Slavery.  After Emancipation those same Africans were allowed to be free, but were not given the chance to make their situation better because the Government did nothing to help them in the way it helped immigrants who came here from Europe.  Continuing on the quest for American greatness still didn‚Äôt materialize because Racism caused a great deal of damage to many people who were not white.  Given the hatred that was felt by Mexicans who were driven back into Mexico, the Chinese who were placed in Interment camps as well as some Japanese because of what happened during Pearl Harbor. Let‚Äôs add in the issues that the Jew, Italians, Polish people dealt with when they were allowed into the country.  Immigration wasn‚Äôt a huge issue since the many people who came were allowed in, and others were not.  Once we hit the Civil Rights era we yet again failed to do what was needed to set straight past misdeeds but only crumbs were given instead.  The Women‚Äôs movement  gave us the ERA movement where making Women equal to Men was the way to go, but it still has a ways to go.  As we moved forward in some degrees, we fell beck as well.  Gay people had it rough but then they decided that it was their time to make some changes so through marches and some action by some fierce Men/Women there are laws in place to help them in this country.  People with Disabilities wanted equal access to help make their lives easier to deal with so with the help of Congress the Disabilities Act was created.  So you see where i‚Äôam going with this, America has a homework assignment it needs to understand that all of its people are in need to be treated fairly.  No one people should have more benefits then others since we are of one Nation under God.

"I'm not a Trump supporter and don't agree with what any of the people said in the video, but... I think it's pretty evident that most commenters here are kind of in their own bubble like many trump supporters. Firstly, by definition, half of all people are of below average intelligence. Secondly, a fair percentage of those of above average intelligence might be sociopaths, psychopaths, have some other illness or disorder. Others may well not be well read, or may not know too much about history, economics or politics. For some their religious affiliation may override all other considerations. From the remaining, you can subtract those that will one way or the other no matter what and you end up with three elligible voters.
Like it or not, these people represent the average voter so, like it or not, you cannot afford to dismiss them as dumb. They are citizens, voters, and your countrymen and women. One of them might one day pull you out of a burning building. Keep in mind, a street interview is not the same as sitting down with them to understand what they think and why they think that. Also the footage is, by it's very nature, going to be selective. Saying how dumb they are might make you feel good but it won't change how they'll vote, and surely that is what matters. Humans act on emotion, and the things they are saying reflect that. The emotions I'm seeing are nostalgia, fear, etc. What they believe is because  those emotions are being fed (essentially by BS). You have to empathise (not agree) with what they are saying to understand why they are saying it and therefore how to change it. I don't know how, but I suspect calling them dumb is fueling the fire.",2024-01-28 19:56:48,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.36867723,['en']

"Look up the numbers. Trump didn't stop illegal immigration, the pandemic did for less than a full year. In Trump's last year, illegal immigration was skyrocketing again, as it was before the pandemic. Mexico never paid for the wall either, but Trump directed funds to political allies to build it. If Biden had done that, they'd be calling Biden corrupt.
And for god's sake, there isn't enough gold to back the size of today's money supply. We outgrew gold.
The economy hasn't ""been destroyed by the Biden administration"". How can anyone not know that we now have one of the most successful economies on Earth? While China and Russia are failing miserably.
How does weakening, or even ditching, NATO keep us strong and ""secure in the world""? Old people like that guy should remember WWII. Weakening NATO invites conflict. Ukraine wasn't mentioned, but what we are spending on that is a fraction of both our own Pentagon budget and what larger war would cost - and Putin has made it clear he wants more than Ukraine.
Trump didn't bring inflation down. It was only 2.1% in 2016. In fact, it was mainly pandemic relief spending that flooded the economy with money and led to high inflation. Well, 2/3 of pandemic relief spending occurred under Trump, approved by Trump. Really, it was his inflation more than Biden's. If anything, Trump made inflation high and Biden brought it down.

A woman couldn't acquire a credit-card in her name without a man's signature, a woman couldn't wear pants to work, a woman didn't have the choice for birth control medication, a Black woman didn't have the ability to Vote, a Black man couldn't work for many government agencies. a Woman Never held a management position in the federal government. these people are children in their minds...things were ""great"" when you had ZERO responsibility or awareness of Vietnam, Watergate, the corruption. 

America was Great when Eisenhower invested in the interstate highway system, allowing integration of schools and warning the US of the outrageous spending on the US Military. America was Great in the 1990's when the unemployment rate was low and tech was accelerating the economy. 

This is the Brainwashing of America...or any attempt to fall into Cults...everything was 'Better"" long ago, (but it wasn't. Things will be ""Great"" when I am dictator, (they won't), everything about ""Today"" is bad""...It Isn't. .

FYI - Reagan DESTROYED the US Middle Class - Stole $2.8 Trillion from social security, ($10 Trillion in 2024 dollars), Reagan Taxed Social Security, Reagans failed economic policies caused the worst Inflation, Recession, Stagflation in the nations history. 

He sold US arms to Terrorists, Ran drugs from Columbia (Cocaine) to finance the illegal wars in Nicaragua and Honduras and Guatemala. He raised the Middle class TAX Rate, Removed all of the Interest deductions you had - car loans, credit card interest, mortgage interest, Lowered Tax Rate for Billionaires from 75% to 27%, Lowered tax rate for corporations from 50% to 25%, , he allowed the US Corporations to close US manufacturing and move overseas, he began a religious crusade, relied on Occult fortune tellers to direct policy, . Removed the ""Fairness doctrine"" to have News stations provide all sides of an issue, Reagan ""Granted"" fox's Murdoch to OWN a television network as a Non-US citizen- which became a wholly owned right-wing propaganda machine, allowed corporations to pay executives in stock options without taxation, lowered the wages of working Americans, economy was in a free-fall.  reagan Destroyed the US Middle-Class....Full stop.",2024-01-28 18:21:11,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.44393396,['en']

Was it when we faked a bombing on one of our own ships to start the Spanish-American war? Was it when we conquered and annexed a third of Mexico? Was it when we had the black population in chains and women weren't allowed to vote? Maybe it was after WW1 when we refused to join the league of nations - directly leading to the failure of that organization and the cause of WW2? Or maybe during WW2 when we turned ships full of Jewish refugees away? Or during WW2 when we, America, were the only nation in history to actually use nuclear weapons, dropping them on cities full of civilians in the 2 single greatest atrocities of the war? How about after WW2 when black veterans came home only to be lynched by the KKK? Was America great while the CIA instigated violence and coups in countries across South America and the middle east on behalf of corporate interests while pretending they were fighting ""commies and socialists""?

Do I really need to go on? America is no, nor was it ever ""great"". It's a nation of lies, violence, hypocrisy and evil. As we speak America is engaged in yet more war, is shielding a proxy state and carrying our ethnic cleansing at best, more likely full scale genocide.

"First person; wants back what he had ""growing up"". I was a grown up when he was growing up and the things he wants back weren't as widely accepted as he thinks. Take for example the election of JFK. When that campaign was run, it was big news and a point of controversy that JFK was a ""catholic"" and he shouldn't be elected because he'd ""be taking orders from the Pope"". So, like may other Americans, this guy has a very idealistic view of what American was like just a few decades ago. First woman; is Trump her reference point for greatness? She hasn't the foggiest idea of past American greatness. I suppose such things like the Korean, Vietnamese and other foreign wars, largely started by the United States were great ideas? She even looks too young to have any idea of what's so great about America.  And it's people like that who are supporting Trump, a man who wasn't even supposed to inherit the Trump empire, who was a conceited, narcissist even as a child.Trump has run most of the Trump businesses into the dirt, cheated investors and customers, claimed bankruptcy [because of poor management] so many times American banks won't loan him money and that's why Trump does business with Duetsche Bank that has a number of Russian oligarchs sitting on the bank board and is likely why Trump is so fond of Putin.   The founding fathers had their fingers crossed their experiment in democracy would work. Unfortunately [they understood this] that democracy is dependent upon an ""educated"" population.

"While there is a lot we are guilty of, we have been a world leader when it comes to growing. The freedoms every individual is granted in this country may ebb in flow in some respects, but has remained significantly above the rest of the globe. China isn‚Äôt free, Muslim cultures regulate women, much of the world is still homophobic. 

A major criticism of the west is colonization, yet we exist thanks to colonials that decided to walk away. They fought to be rid of that system and start their own. From that day to today, we have grown *so* much. Especially so compared to other nations. We argue our differences in the public square. Some win, some lose, but we continue to push towards progress. That should be something we are proud of. 

The Civil War is something we should be proud of. Civil rights is something we should be proud of. Gay marriage and women‚Äôs suffrage as well. 

WWII is something people consider a hot take, and I agree that the pacific campaign was horrific, but even the Japanese conceded that they likely would not have surrendered otherwise. They were the nation to train kamikaze after all. 

To the point; there are aggressors and victims throughout history. Many nations have been on both sides of that fence. It‚Äôs about what they do in the long term and we have done more than 95% of the globe in most every department. It‚Äôs hard to find a place more free or safe- though that has been falling apart over the past few years.",2024-01-28 17:29:45,"Trumpers Triggered When Asked ""When Was America Great""",0.17025198,['en']
